Hi, this repository contains the files for our ESA, MSO 2D Project. 

The following is included inside:
1. A pdf version of our presentation files
2. 5 csv files which contain all our data in our database
3. Screenshots of our functional frontend application (Power Apps)
4. The backend Python code (main.py) to fetch all the data from the backend server to display it on the frontend Power Apps using FastAPI 


Our MRP system is easy-to-use as it eliminates the need for the user to perform any query in order to make any changes to the data.
All they need to do is enter the part_id into the search bar to start. 
Version Control and Data Consistency is our main focus when implementing this MRP system. As such, users will also not need to worry about any errors regarding the changes as our system accounts for them within our backend code.

How to use our interface:
1. Login into optiMRP
2. Click on any of the 5 pages of your choosing
3. Add/Edit/Delete any entry you want
4. Once done, click 'Ok' and click on the 'Refresh' button on the top right corner to update the page with the new change
5. Click on the Home button at the top right corner (next to the 'Refresh' button) to return back to the home page
6. Repeat steps 2-5
